# Easy Carry    
### Purpose: 
One of the key problems in venture fund management is the calculation of carry interests, which needs to be done at each investor level, given that the investors come at different time. This project is to create an APP which will make it easier to calculate carry interests.  
### Outcome: 
Easy Carry is the successful solution to the problem.  
### Installlation:
Go to site easycarry.com. Click download at the bottom left of the home page and wait about 15 sections to download and auto installation. 
### Features:
Allows for carry calculations every time there is capital activity (contributions and distributions). Allows for calculation of carry on a deal-by-deal basis as well as at the fund level. Allows for the calculation of claw back in case too much carry was taken by the general partner at interim. Allow for calculation of preferred returns for investors. 
### Example: 
Say an investor comes 6 months after a fund was launched. That investor will have their carry calculations as well as their preferred return prorated.
